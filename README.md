# A Process Scheduler Simulator Implementation 
This work will be delivered as an assignment work for an Operating System course.

Implementing a Process Scheduler Simulator that will support the following Scheduling Algorithms:
* First Come, First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling
* Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling
* Round-Robin (RR) Scheduling

You can read more about these scheduling disciplines [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Scheduling_disciplines)

## Running the GUI:
You can run the GUI using Python2 or Python 3, it imports the suitable libraries.
Just clone the repository on your device and double click the Scheduler_Simulator.py file, that's it :D
