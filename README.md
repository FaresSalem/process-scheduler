## A Process Scheduler Simulator Implementation 
This work will be delivered as an assignment work for an Operating System course.

Hopefully, We'll implement a Process Scheduler Simulator that will support the following Scheduling Algorithms:
* First Come, First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling
* Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling
* Round-Robin (RR) Scheduling
