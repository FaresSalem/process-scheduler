# A Process Scheduler Simulator Implementation 
Implementing a Process Scheduler Simulator as an assignment work for an Operating System course that will support the following Scheduling Algorithms:
* First Come, First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling
* Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling
* Round-Robin (RR) Scheduling

You can read more about these scheduling disciplines [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Scheduling_disciplines)


## Running the GUI:
### Dependencies:
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html)
* [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) (and, since Python 3.1, ttk) which is included in the Python standard library. It relies on Tcl/Tk being installed on your system. Depending on how you install Python, this may not happen automatically.

You can run the GUI using Python2 or Python 3, it imports the suitable libraries.
Just clone the repository on your device and double click the Scheduler_Simulator.py file, that's it :D
You could also run it using:
```
python /PATH/TO/Scheduler_Simulator.py
```
