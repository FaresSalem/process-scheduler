## A Process Scheduler Implementation 
This work will be delivered as an assignment work for an Operating System course.

Hopefully, We'll start implementing a Process Scheduler that will support the following Scheduling Algorithms:
* First Come, First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling
* Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
* Round-Robin (RR) Scheduling

you can read more about these scheduling disciplines [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Scheduling_disciplines)
